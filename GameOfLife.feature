  Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
  >
  > At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  > 1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies, as if by loneliness.
  > 1. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
  > 1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
  > 1. Reproduction (birth): Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors comes to life.
